OktaCSV pulls the Okta Event logs and streams the output to the Console.

It is written in the GO Language, and can run interpreted (GO Compiles it on the fly),
or run the contained binaries for the platform you are running.

It is very easy to Modify and Customize, and I hope others find it useful
