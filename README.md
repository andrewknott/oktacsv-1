##OktaCSV pulls the Okta Event logs and streams the output to the Console.

It is written in the GO Language, and can run interpreted (GO Compiles it on the fly),
or run the contained binaries for the platform you are running.

It is very easy to Modify and Customize, and I hope others find it useful

OktaCSV is checking to see what time it is in OktaLand, and starting to follow the System Log<br/>
This can take a few seconds, but it is worth the wait<br/>
